# Blue Sphere Studios via Vue

A rebuild of my portfolio site using Vue in order to try out and tinker with
Vue.js.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Deploy
```
npm run deploy
```
Runs `npm run build && firebase deploy --only hosting`, deploys to Firebase project

### Notes

This old version of Vue 2 and Vue Router 3 seem to only run as-is on node v14.0.0

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
